# AutoZenGarden

**// About this project //**

Are you lazy? Do you like Coins? Do you like Zombies and Gardens?

If this is you, look no further!

**AutoZenGarden** is a simple app that automatically collcts coins in your Plants Vs Zombies 'Zen Garden'!

It is a rather straight-forward program that just repeatedly presses across the screen at set intervals and pre-set positions that are known to work. If coins are too close or over-lapping, it will get them on the next lap (:

# How to Use

Run CollectCoins.ahk and when you are ready with your PvZ window open and your plants watered, simply right-click the Star logo on the start menu and press '**Auto Collect Coins**'

Once the app is running, simply press [ESC] on the keyboard to stop it.

Note that the Plants vs Zombies window will need to be active (in Windowed mode) for this to function.
